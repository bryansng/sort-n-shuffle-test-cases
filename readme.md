&nbsp;
## Characteristics
- The Knuth Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm used in the iPod Playlist is inserted into the sortAndShuffle.c file. One could modify the pre-processor directive variables to enable the use of the algorithm to prove that the algorithm is unbiased.

&nbsp;
## Task - Create a program that tests the quicksort and fisherYates methods provided.
